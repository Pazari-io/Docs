*A brief summary of AVAX.*<br/>
AVAX is the abbreviation for the Avalanche block chain.<br/>
Pazari has created our own custom smart contract system that is built within the Avalanche ecosystem. We leverage the power of block chain to work as your payment processor, storage, file encryption encoding and watermarking. This has been streamlined, for you, the creator.

Each of these deserves its own full break down and tutorials on how to interact with the Pazari smact contract system. Those will be covered in the upcoming sections, detailing those technical aspects.
