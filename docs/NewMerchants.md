# Sellers/Merchants
## Quick Rundown
To become a Merchant on Pazari all you need to do is put an item up for sale. You will be automatically given a Merchant's profile linked to your Metamask browser wallet, and it is not important to fill out immediately. Thanks to our one-click-wonder button you don't need to do a bunch of complicated blockchain transactions, only one transaction will be required, and no personal information needs to be taken in as part of profile creation.

Pazari does not charge anything for new users to sign up, but the Avalanche network may incur a fee of several dollars' worth of AVAX that is only paid one time. After that, each new item you list for sale will only cost a few dimes to tokenize and list, depending on both network activity and the market price of AVAX.

## Steps - Becoming a Pazari Merchant:
### 1. Create new token listing on Pazari.io
   On any page, click on your profile icon in the top right corner, and click Upload Item.
   
   Select the item type, select the sub-category that best fits your item, and fill out the forms. If you are uploading a PDF file, then the first thing you will upload is the PDF itself, then on the product details page you will upload the cover.
   
   Once you are done with filling out the product details then click on Save. The Pazari engine will then prepare your content for tokenization, which can take a minute or longer depending on the size of the file being uploaded, so be patient. This is the stage when all original file encryption and preview watermarking takes place, and your Web2 content gets ready to make its first debut in the Web3 world.
   
   Once the tokenization process is ready for the last stage--minting your tokens--a Metamask pop-up will appear asking you to confirm a transaction and will tell you how much the "gas fee" is (in AVAX). Click confirm and wait several seconds for the blockchain network to receive and process your order, it should take no longer than about 5 seconds to get a response. You'll know when it worked if you hear a little chime and see a notification in the bottom right corner of the screen saying "Transaction Confirmed!".

### 2. That's it, there is no Step 2, you're done!
