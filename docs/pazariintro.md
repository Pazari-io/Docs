## Pazari is a digital market for the digital age
Pazari is a digital-only marketplace built on Web3, and aims to become a place where you can buy *anything* digital. Unlike Web2 platforms, Pazari specializes in selling tokens and tokenized content.

At a first glance Pazari looks like another Shutterstock , Evanto Elements, Getty, but Pazari aims to be far more than that. Pazari is comparable to these products in the same way Amazon is comparible to a newspaper stand--they both sell things and have some overlap, but one business sells a *lot* more than the other, both in variety and quantity. Pazari's variety of file types will rival that of The Pirate Bay--but without the pirates. Pazari is novel and utilizes Web3 to make life a lot easier for indie publishers at the current stage.

For now, the number of file types that Pazari will support will be limited, but over time Pazari will roll out support for many different kinds of tokenized goods, from the most obvious to the most exotic. Anything that can be "tokenized" can be sold on Pazari, and anything digital can be tokenized. Pazari aims to provide a marketplace for even the most rare and interesting tokens that cannot exist anywhere else.

Pazari is not just a place to buy stock art and other similar assets. Eventually you will find so much more in items like ebooks, NFTs, games, subscriptions, online services, charitable causes, startup fundraising, venture capital investing, DeFi services... and so forth.

* ***<font color='salmon'>Anything that can be tokenized can be sold on Pazari!</font>*** 

Pazari facilitates the content tokenization process and makes it very easy for sellers to get what they want to sell onto Web3 and listed on the Pazari marketplace, and will soon facilitate the creation and sale of NFTs and unique NFT collections. It is accurate to say that we "wrap" your content inside of a token, which enables it to move on Web3.

Pazari will be owned and ran by its Merchants through a DAO-based governance system. Only verified sellers can become Merchants and participate in platform governance.

We believe this approach to digital marketplaces will ultimately provide a more interesting and rewarding experience for all users.
