# Setting Up for Web3
The first two things everyone will need, whether they are buyers or Merchants, is the Metamask browser extension and an Avalanche wallet. If you already have these things, then skip ahead to the next section, otherwise keep reading.

## Steps For Setting Up
### 1. Download and install Metamask
If you don't have a Metamask browser wallet, then you will need one. This is your gateway to Web3, and will hold and manage all your blockchain assets--including your earnings payments and any Pazari market items you've purchased. You can get it here:

https://metamask.io/

### 2. Open an Avalance Wallet
There are a few tutorials online for how to do this, just be sure it's the Avalanche network, ticker symbol AVAX. You can create a new wallet fairly easily, just go here:

https://wallet.avax.network/create

Click "Generate Key Phrase" and write down the 24 words you see.

### 3. Import Avalanche Wallet into Metamask
Next we need to import our Avalanche wallet into Metamask. 

First, go to your Avalanche wallet and click "Manage Keys" on the left-hand sidebar. The least secure way to proceed that would be fine for buyers and light sellers is to find and click on "View C Chain Private Key". Copy this key to your clipboard so you can paste it into Metamask in a moment. However, if you are planning on using this address for some time and you intend to keep large amounts of money in it, then we recommend you click the little download button right next to this to export your wallet in a password-locked file--with a *very* secure password!

Although, if you are planning on becoming a Merchant and using Pazari as a primary source of income, then we suggest investing in a hardware wallet, which is the most secure way to protect your earnings online.

This key *is* your wallet, so treat it as though you are holding a real wallet and don't put it anywhere it can be accessed by anyone else, and definitely don't email it yourself.

Once you have your private key or key file, open Metamask, click on the colorful circle icon in the top-right to bring up your accounts drop-down menu, then click "Import Account". Paste your private key in here, and click "Import". Now your wallet should be all ready to go for Metamask, and we are ready to obtain some AVAX.

### 3. Obtain some AVAX
Next, you will need AVAX in your wallet. AVAX is a "gas token", a special cryptocurrency used to pay for network fees on its parent blockchain network, which in our case is Avalanche. Every action which changes the blockchain's records incurs a small fee to keep the network running. Why this fee is important is a deep rabbit-hole that we would encourage everyone to explore so it makes sense what you are paying for and why the fees are variable.

There are two ways you can obtain AVAX cryptocurrency: Either buy some on an exchange like Coinbase (United States), Binance (non-US), or KuCoin (global) and withdraw it to your new Avalanche wallet, or you can purchase some on the Pangolin DEX and have it directly deposited into your wallet--for a $5 convenience fee.

If you are new to crypto and blockchain, or if you're only here for Pazari, then the easiest and safest way to do this is to use Pangolin's fiat onramp, since you won't have to pass invasive KYC to use it, and you won't have to risk entering the wrong withdrawal address to move your AVAX off of an exchange.

However, if you are a Merchant then you will need an exchange for cashing out your earnings, so one way or another you will need an exchange account and you will need to learn how to use it, but it isn't important for right now. If you are a buyer, then you won't actually need an exchange account at all and can theoretically do everything "on-chain".

Whether you're a buyer or a seller, you won't need much AVAX. About 0.1 AVAX will take care of buyers' and sellers' gas fees for some time, however if you are a buyer then you will also need to buy an amount of AVAX equal to the dollar amount you want to take with you to Pazari *plus* some for gas. So, if you want to bring $50 with you to Pazari, then you will need to purchase $50 of AVAX plus another 0.1 AVAX for gas (at an example price of $65/AVAX, you could buy 1 AVAX and have more than enough).
