## Quick Rundown
Did you open an Avalanche wallet, download + install Metamask, import your Avalanche wallet to Metamask, and then obtain some AVAX? If not, then go back and do that first. If you did, then we're ready to move on!

## Steps

### 1. Swap AVAX for MIM
First thing we need is some MIM (Magic Internet Money), which is a stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are always worth $1 USD, but currently not many exchanges sell MIM, so we will need to use the Trader Joe DEX to get some MIM.

Follow this link and you will see the swapping interface. The top bar is for the coins you are trading away, which defaults to AVAX, and the bottom bar is for the coins you are trading for. 

First, connect your wallet using either the "Connect to a Wallet" button in the top-right corner or the "Connect Wallet" button below the swapping interface. Once your wallet is connected, click the bottom token's icon and type "MIM" in the search bar, and select "Magic Internet Money" from the list (it should be the only option). Then, in the bottom bar type in how much--in USD--you would like to take with you to Pazari ($10 may do fine)

Once you've entered the amount of MIM you would like to trade for, click "Swap", and then confirm the swap. Your Metamask will pop-up with a transaction confirmation. If everything looks good, then go head and confirm the transaction and wait a few seconds for the network to confirm it. Once it confirms, you are now ready to visit Pazari.io to go buy your first item(s).

You may need to click "Add MIM to Wallet" below the trading interface so you can view your balance in your Metamask wallet, and you should do this for any tokens you swap for on a DEX.

### 2. Buy item(s)
Go to Pazari and head over to the Marketplace. Pick a category, select any search filters you would like, and then find an item to purchase. Click on the item to go to the product details page.

If you haven't logged in yet, then you will be prompted to do so when you click the "Buy" button. This will connect your wallet to Pazari, and is required for interacting with any blockchain applications.

The first time you buy an item after connecting your wallet you will have to approve Pazari to spend your MIM stablecoins. Confirm this transaction and wait a few seconds. 

Once Pazari has been approved to spend your MIM, then click "Buy" again, this time a new transaction window will appear for the actual purchase of the item. Confirm this transaction and wait a few seconds again.

### 3. Download item's content
Once your purchase has confirmed you now own the tokenized content in your wallet! The "Buy" button will turn into a "Download" button, which initiates the file download when clicked.

And that's it! You are now able to view and use your downloaded file.
