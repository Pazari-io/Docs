# Roadmap
This is a rough outline of our roadmap, to be worked on in much greater depth post-hackathon. Note that the biggest obstacle to the completion of roadmap milestones is a lack of front-end developers. Securing some funding is a priority for this project so we can increase the size of our team.

## Q1 2022
### Survive and win the Avalanche hackathon
### Establish social media channels
### Begin writing on Pazari Blog
### Deployment of functional MVP on Fuji testnet
### Call for investors I
### Begin Pazari Beta

## Q2 2022
### Finish and deploy Pazari Beta
### Push for new sellers, buyers, and beta testers
### Call for investors II
### Begin work on Pazari V1
### Begin work on Pazari Governance Token
### Begin work on PazariDAO

## Q3 2022
### Deploy Pazari Governance Token, or ARC20 Representation 
### Deploy Pazari's RC version (engine, front-end, and contracts)
### Call for investors III
### Begin work on Pazari Collaborations

## Q4 2022
### Deploy Pazari V1
### Massive marketing push for mass-adoption
### Social media influencer coverage
### Begin Multi-Chain Bridge for Polygon, BSC, and Fantom

## 2023 and Beyond
### Deploy Multi-Chain Bridge
### Continue marketing push, advertise, offer new seller incentives
### Major exchange listings of PGT
### Begin Pazari Subscriptions
### Begin Pazari Services
### Begin Pazari Auctions
### Begin DRM Tokens (i.e. fully tradable, non-downloadable ebooks)
### Begin Pazari desktop dApp

# Tentative Milestones
Some milestones are less predictable or necessary than others, these are milestones that should be set and achieved if conditions are right.

### Deploy Pazari DAO
When population of Merchants exceeds 50, Pazari DAO will be deployed

### Create and Deploy Gas Station Network
If managing gas fees proves burdensome for UX, then we create and deploy a gas station network to make it easier on visitors, and will serve as another source of revenue for the platform.

### Deploy Pazari Governance Token
If there's not enough time / developers to work on PGT in Q2, then we will use an ARC20 representation of PGT until the Pazari DAO is deployed.

### Begin work on Token Holder Benefits Program
The Token Holder Benefits (THB) program involves creating video workshops on converting a Web2 website into a Web3 dApp and then using it to check for tokens in a visitor's wallet and reveal hidden content, actions, and bonuses if found. A section of Pazari will be set up for THB developers to create profiles and pitch their services to sellers who want to set up benefits for their token holders. THB developers can work for a flat rate, a percentage of item sales, or any other arrangement made with the seller.
