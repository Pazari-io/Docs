# Reasons to Buy
There are a number of reasons why you should shop on Pazari!

## Pazari sells tokenized content
When you shop on Pazari you aren't shopping for digital downloads or content, you are shopping for tokens, which can have very different uses or perks depending on the Merchant. Some tokens are just digital content like what you could find on Shutterstock, but some tokens are much more than that.

Pazari's underlying engine automatically tokenizes the content that is sold on it. This means the actual content itself is "wrapped" inside of a cryptocurrency token, similar to an NFT, where it can then be transferred between crypto wallets instead of through email or direct download. It also allows the token to be programmed, which is what allows Pazari to exist.

The primary benefit is that as long as you have access to your crypto wallet then you will have access to all the content you've bought on Pazari as well, even if your device dies.

As a secondary benefit, Merchants on Pazari are encouraged to explore token holder benefits as a way to provide more value than their content alone can provide. By being a token holder of these Merchants you will gain access to opportunities like special benefits, perks, unlockable content, giveaways, and even entry to online token holder communities or membership areas--whatever the Merchant chooses to do. We encourage Merchants to make this a core feature of their business on Pazari, as it utilizes the biggest advantages of cryptocurrency tokens to explore new business models.

## Join and participate in communities and DAOs
Not only can tokens be used for token holder rewards and benefits, but they can also be used for the establishment and management of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations--or DAOs.

If

## No credit cards or banks
You don't need to provide any banking information *at all* to use Pazari, since Pazari runs on stablecoins and cryptocurrency. Stablecoins are programmable and can be sent from one person to another without the use of a bank, and the transfer happens much faster than a bank transfer--and the Merchants don't have to pay credit card fees nor must they account for clawbacks in their business models.

The caveat here is that you will need to provide banking or personal information of some kind in order to obtain stablecoins and cryptocurrencies, but that process has nothing to do with Pazari. We do not hold any of your sensitive banking information.

## We don't gather user data
We have no use for it, and people are sick of companies harvesting and selling their data anyways. Wouldn't it be nice to shop online without fear that a single hack could expose your banking and personal information to the dark web?

Pazari does not gather any of this information, and Pazari does not *need* this information to function--unlike Web2 platforms who rely on banking systems--therefore there is nothing to be leaked.

## Find "The Next Big Thing" on Pazari
There are many hidden opportunities you may find on Pazari for purchasing content that hasn't gone big yet. While Pazari primarily focuses on digital download tokens, it is also ready to accept NFTs on its marketplace, and in time Pazari will be able to facilitate NFT drops and launches that could go big.

These opportunities will most likely be used as fundraisers for artists, authors, and creators of all kinds that would otherwise never stand a chance at receiving the funding they need to be successful. Now, Pazari offers a way for these creators to crowdfund their ideas while providing an easy way for them to reward their early buyers. This is better than using a GoFundMe page, since as a buyer you are not just donating your money--you are purchasing an actual product, and that purchase may well contribute towards their success.

Pazari is a place where creators of all kinds can go to find a new audience with different goals and interests than their existing audience on Web2, and you may well find The Next Big Thing just by shopping on Pazari.

## Access a global marketplace
Pazari is built on blockchain technology, which is available to anyone in the world who has access to the internet and cryptocurrency--and the population of crypto users worldwide is growing exponentially (and faster than the internet did in its early days). There is tremendous talent trapped inside people who can't monetize it due to their geographic or economic situation, and Pazari grants people the opportunity to change that.

You can tap into a much larger selection of content from Merchants living in nations that are otherwise restricted by Web2 platforms and various policies. Also, some people simply don't have access to bank accounts, and therefore can never monetize their talents because they have no way to take payments and cash out. However, Web3 promises a solution to bridge this gap, by providing automated financial services that anyone can use if they can access it.

By purchasing from these sellers you are helping them to survive in their respective nations and to share wealth you take for granted with people for whom it makes a huge difference.

## Buying on Pazari helps sellers--a LOT
Web2 platforms like Shutterstock and Amazon are massively greedy when it comes to platform fees, and sellers on these platforms are missing out on lots of income because of it--and quite unfairly so. Pazari has created a system that can be run with very low overhead costs, and therefore permits its Merchants to keep more out of every sale.

So, if you find one of your favorite Amazon authors or Shutterstock photographers selling the same things on Pazari, then buying it from them here will help them out a LOT more than buying it on Web2 ever will--especially if they're from Shutterstock.

On Shutterstock, sellers make 15% - 40% commission on their work, depending on how many sales they've made. On Amazon, ebook sellers make 30% - 70% commissions, depending on if they sell within Amazon's price range of $2.99 - $9.99.

On Pazari, sellers make *95%* commissions on their work, no matter how many items they've sold, and no matter what the price is. For obvious reasons, then greatly helps our Merchants and pulls money away from the dominating influence of Web2 platforms.

# Plans for The Future
## Access a unique marketplace
Pazari will provide the tools for group projects to be undertaken, completed, and sold on Pazari without any middlemen holding or distributing each member's commissions. We will also make it as easy as possible for Pazari Merchants and creators to meet each other and combine their skills to collaborate on group projects that can generate much more revenue for each of the members.

Because of this, Pazari will be the only place where these groups can form, create, and sell work that couldn't exist otherwise, and for each member to be paid fairly without needing to trust anyone to handle the commissions distribution process. Pazari uses smart contracts to distribute payments and manage inventory, which also permits these kinds of unique projects to exist.

We believe this could open new markets that don't exist yet, and that *can't* exist on Web2. For you as a buyer, this means you may find more useful and interesting items to buy on Pazari than you can anywhere else, and that quality increase is a benefit to all buyers.
