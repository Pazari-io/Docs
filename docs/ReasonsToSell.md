# Introduction
Pazari is a digital-only marketplace built on Web3, and aims to become a place where you can buy *anything* digital--within reason.

Pazari is comparable to Shutterstock in the same way Amazon is comparible to a gas station. At a first glance Pazari looks like another Shutterstock, but look closer and you'll find that Pazari sells many additional "things" that Shutterstock does not. 

*Anything* that can be tokenized can be sold on Pazari, and almost anything can be tokenized--and Pazari will slowly roll out support for many different kinds of tokenized goods, from the most obvious to the most exotic. 

Pazari is not just a place to buy stock art and other assets, eventually you will find much more than that in things like ebooks, NFTs, gaming, subscriptions, online services, charitable causes, startup fundraising, venture capital investing, DeFi--the list goes on and on. 

Pazari is a *universal* digital marketplace. If you can store something in a website URL, then you can tokenize it and sell it on Pazari, even if it is something unusual or abstract. Pazari also facilitates the tokenization process and makes it very easy for its Merchants to get what they want to sell onto the marketplace in a tokenized form, and will also facilitate the creation and sale of NFTs.

Pazari will be owned and ran by its Merchants through a DAO-like entity, and so it will not be subjected to the same level of centralized governance that is present in most Web2 platforms and corporations. We believe centralization of power over a platform that processes huge amounts of value only leads to the creation of greedy and harmful policy changes, and eventually launches damaging enforcement actions against its own sellers. Pazari will not be run by a CEO or a board of directors, but instead will be run by its Merchants through a majority voting system.

We believe this approach to digital marketplaces will ultimately provide a more interesting and rewarding experience for all users.

## The Problem
Let's just look at two of the biggest Web2 platforms that sell digital file downloads. Shutterstock lets you keep a whole 15% of your item sales just starting out, and then they have the courtesy of letting you keep 40% when you're successful. Amazon takes 70% of your ebook sales if you sell outside the price range of $2.99 - $9.99, and they're kind enough to only take 30% if you sell within their preferred range.

These are just two examples, but the fact they exist at all is telling of the age we live in. Digital marketplaces in Web2 own a monopoly now on their respective niches, and they know most sellers will take the terrible commissions they offer because they don't have any alternatives. Pazari aims to be that alternative.

## The Solution
Because blockchain applications are able to run very cheap, Pazari is able to create a platform that requires less than 5% sales tax to work. We are hoping to take it down to 3% over time as the platform grows and more users join. 

By comparison, if you're a *very* successful Shutterstock seller, then selling on Pazari means you will keep almost 2.5 times more in commissions. If you're just beginning on Shutterstock then Pazari is offering to let you keep over *six times* the commissions for the same things.

Also by comparison, Pazari is offering ebook publishers a 40% increase in ebook sales commissions within Amazon's approved price range, and outside of that range Pazari offers over three times the amount per sale.

About 5% of all item sales are transferred to the Pazari treasury at the moment of sale, and the rest goes to you.

We are able to do this so cheaply because Web3 is built to handle the transfer of value at the protocol level, just as the internet you know and rely on is able to transfer information at its protocol level. All value transferred over a blockchain network is programmable, which is how Pazari is able to exist.

Which brings us to the next many reasons why Pazari is the marketplace you didn't know you needed.

## What other perks does Pazari offers?
Merchants are Pazari's life-force, and without them Pazari would have no purpose for existing. Merchants are rewarded greatly through numerous benefits and perks beyond just cheaper sales taxes than Web2 platforms, and many of these perks are unique to Web3 and blockchain technology and cannot be replicated by Web2 digital marketplaces. Pazari will grant a truly unique and powerful experience for its Merchants, and we believe it will more than rival the Web2 platforms that dominate the internet today.

So let's get into why that is.

### Instant Payments
You are paid your earnings instantly after every item sale. Yes, *instantly!* This is because of the Avalanche blockchain's "transaction finality" time.

Transaction finality is the time it takes for a transaction to "settle" and become irreversible, and the Avalanche network boasts a transaction finality time of 2 seconds. By comparison, bank to bank transfers can take up to 5 business days, and most Web2 platforms will only pay out on a schedule that you don't have much control over.

So, 2 seconds for your money to arrive in your wallet and be ready for you to use it is pretty awesome for obvious reasons.

If you are a single-seller Merchant then you can have every item sale deposited directly into your Avalanche wallet instantly after every purchase. You can also opt for your earnings to be deposited into your Pazari account after each purchase, and can be collected at any time. In fact, this method is cheaper on your customers, and it allows you to collect your payments in batches rather than receiving a trickle--which could be helpful for income taxes in certain jurisdictions. 

If you opt to have your payments deposited into your Pazari account, then your payments will stay in your account until you choose to collect them. They will always be available when you need them, so there is no risk with letting Pazari hold your earnings for you until you collect them.


### No Clawbacks
Merchants in the real world and Web2 often hate accepting credit cards because of the risk of clawbacks. 

A clawback happens when a customer wrongfully claims to their bank that that their card was stolen and that they didn't purchase the item they just bought from the merchant. When this happens the bank issuing the card reverses the transaction and freezes the card without question--thus stealing the merchant's rightly earned income and letting the scammer get away with theft. That's too bad for you. Merchants in return will often increase the prices of all goods and services to compensate for the average losses incurred by this phenomenon.

That is not a problem on Pazari. Blockchain technology was designed to facilitate irreversible peer-to-peer payments that are even *less* reversible than paying someone in cash, and Pazari is a digital marketplace built on blockchain.

So, scammers have no ability to steal money back that they just paid to you, unless you give it back. if a customer claims you ripped them off, then that's too bad for them. It's your responsibility as a Pazari Merchant to work it out with the customer on your terms, and keeping the money they paid you *is* an option that you have.

Thus, your earnings are safe here.

### No Hidden Fees
There are exactly *two* types of fees on Pazari: Sales tax, and gas fees.

Sales tax is around 5%, and can be adjusted over time to meet the needs of the platform's growth and survival in the long-term. In the future there will be attractive incentives for Merchants who *choose* to pay higher taxes, but it will not be required to do so. Pazari sales tax is deducted immediately after a purchase and before commissions / earnings are distributed / deposited.

If Pazari in the future needs to roll out other types of fees, then we will be open and transparent about it. Pazari is an open-source, community-directed project, and all fees that are implemented will be open and community-approved.

### Automated Royalty Payments
Pazari's payments engine is capable of automatically handling royalty commissions to multiple recipients. Merchants can create additional payment routes with more than one recipient for projects with more than one contributor, and each contributor will be paid according to their commission rate.

This enables royalties to be paid out without a trusted third-party to distribute the payments.

### Tokenized Content
This subject warrants some explanation, as it's a little hard to understand how powerful this is without context.

If you're familiar at all with the NFT craze, then you've probably wondered why anyone would spend hundreds--or hundreds of *thousands*--of dollars on a JPEG that anyone can copy. Why do Crypto Punks go for $100,000 at their lowest prices? How do people justify buying junk NFTs for over $100 a piece? How can anyone justify spending millions to buy an EtherRock that is a *literal* picture of a cartoon rock?

And why do some people think it's reasonable to spend this kind of money on a JPEG image that anyone can copy and paste in their browser in the first place?

It's because of the *token*, not the actual content!

In Web2, the content is the only thing that drives value, whether the content is an ebook, a JPEG, a movie, or what-not, so it is easy to see why people don't understand how NFTs command immensely more value than the content they display. NFTs are not just the sum of their the content, it's the *token* that drives much of the value alongside the content.

The examples above are actually pretty terrible, because Crypto Punks and EtherRocks were the first "NFTs" ever created, even before the term existed, so they hold immense historical value--and that's why they are valued so highly. However, value (and beauty) lies in the eye of the beholder, and if your tokens bring value that someone else wants, then you can successfully drive that value to your work due to the properties of tokenized content.

Tokens are programmable and serve as a digital deed of ownership, and there is a LOT that can be done with these properties that drives value toward them. You can create private chat groups for token holders, giveaways that only token holders qualify for, and many creative perks and benefits that drive people to want to buy your tokens--even if they're spending over $100 for a single token whose content can barely command a $5 price tag on Shutterstock. You don't need to invent the next Pudgy Penguins to be successful at selling tokenized content, especially if you can provide exclusive value to your fans if they buy your content on Pazari.

Depending on the perks you provide for your token holders, you can drive a LOT more value toward your tokenized content than you could ever receive from selling the content itself--and therefore, content that you have to sell for cheap on Web2 can be sold for many times more on Web3--if you build strong incentives for people to buy your tokens.

It makes a little more sense now, right?

If you can find a Web3 developer, then your website can be programmed with instructions for what to do if it finds one of your Pazari Tokens in a visitor's wallet (or even *specific* tokens, including tokens that aren't yours). Pazari will provide resources over time that will assist Merchants with establishing token holder benefits and perks, and eventually a whole section of Pazari will be set up where you will be able to find a Web3 developer who specializes in setting up token holder benefits on private websites. We believe this feature is a great and undervalued opportunity that will become the default standard for how to sell downloadable content online, and will ultimately become the norm for content creators of all fields.

### Programmed Scarcity
Unlike Web2 platforms, you can create and sell a finite quantity of your items, and those tokens will be the only tokens of their kind to ever exist. Scarcity, when leveraged and marketed well, can drive huge amounts of value toward your items. This can be used as a powerful fundraising mechanism as well, such as for projects you want to start, or for donations to charitable causes where a specific amount of money needs to be raised.

There is also plenty of content that its creator spent a lot of time working on, and they would like to sell the rights to use or own it to someone else for a large price. Although there is no legal backing at this time for doing so, you could sell the intellectual property rights of your work to someone for a very large price by minting a single token which represents the individual's ownership of your work, and then selling it for many thousands of MIM.

Where this property really shines though is in scarce stock content. This can be media files that are intended for use as stock media in others' productions, but since you only created a small number of tokens that means only a small number of people will ever own or use that content--and therefore it can be sold for much higher prices.


### No Price Controls
Do you want to sell an extremely valuable ebook for $50 on Amazon? Too bad, because Amazon will take most of your earnings if you do that.

Amazon charges ebook authors 70% sales tax when they list an ebook for more than $9.99, and they don't distinguish ebook bundles either or the value of the content contained within. They do this to keep ebook prices in the $2.99 - $9.99 range, which does not afford authors enough to live on after Amazon's 30% highway-robbery tax has been taken out.

Pazari charges everyone the same minimum tax no matter what the price of their item is, and if you take advantage of the benefits of tokenized content then you can get away with selling your content for *higher* on Pazari than anywhere else. In fact, we encourage that you take advantage of the incredible uses of blockchain technology to provide unique incentives for your Pazari customers, which will justify charging *much* higher prices.

### Tap into a global marketplace
Pazari is built on blockchain technology, which is available to anyone in the world who has access to the internet and cryptocurrency--and the population of crypto users worldwide is growing exponentially faster than the internet did.

This means your content will be available for purchase by a potentially much larger audience than you will ever find on Web2 platforms, and they can come from many different walks of life and may have different interests that you can tap into. 

Your content will also be accessible by people who don't have bank accounts, but who do own crypto. It is strange, but in some countries citizens have smart phones and internet access, but no bank accounts--and there is literally trillions of USD in value that is locked up in these countries due to their lack of financial infrastructure. While it isn't a common phenomenon, crypto does allow people to use financial services without access to a financial system, which means your products will also be accessible to those people--and thus, your content will be accessible to more people.


## Future Perks
These are platform benefits that are not immediately available, but are in R&D and will be rolled out over time as Pazari grows and evolves--or as the community requests us to explore them. These are all realistic ideas of what can be done for Pazari because of what blockchain technology allows us to do, and some of them may seem far-fetched to people for whom this is their first Web3 experience, but people familiar with crypto won't be surprised by some of these amibitious goals. 

We won't go into too much detail, but will provide some overviews of the perks you can expect to see in the future and how some of them compare to your Web2 options.

### Pazari Collaborations
This is a very big feature that is projected to roll out around the Pazari V1 era. What this system will do is provide all Pazari users with an area where skills and services can be offered or requested in order to meet other creators and create group projects. These projects will be owned collectively by the individuals who sign a smart contract with each other detailing the terms of their participation (their desired commission rate), and will not be dominated by any one person. Item management will also be done through group voting and group participation as well, so nobody will ever be able to single-handedly change the price of the item or delete it.

Once everyone's terms have been set and the project decided upon, the new team then works together to bring their project to life. Once complete and listed on the market, the project's sales will be automatically split between the collaborators of the project according to the commission rates that they signed up for, thus automatically handling payment distribution for royalties without any intermediaries from that point forward--indefinitely.

The more Collaborations you participate in, the more passive income you will make from sales of those projects, and we believe it will become a primary way in which Merchants make money on Pazari.

### Your Earnings Earn Interest
It is not difficult in the blockchain world for your earnings to be used in other applications to generate interest, and upon popular request this feature will be explored and rolled out to all Merchants who want it. What this would do is allow any earnings you choose to keep in your Pazari account to generate interest automatically using the magical power of DeFi yield farming. So, not only would we never impose minimum holding periods, but any earnings you choose to keep on the platform would generate earnings of their own.

### Platform Governance Rights and Platform Ownership
Later, as Pazari grows and matures we will begin transitioning our leadership roles over to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) run by all Pazari Merchants, and through which you will have the ability to vote on and propose new platform policies and changes. 

Think of it as a "Merchants' Guild" that you are automatically a part of just by being a Merchant on Pazari, and as such you have the opportunity to own and run the platform with your fellow Merchants--if you choose to do so. It's entirely optional, of course.

Votes will be cast in the form of Pazari Governance Tokens (PGT). PGT will be earned by paying higher-than-minimum sales taxes, and will also be buyable from a DEX (Decentralized Exchange). Extra PGT can be used to cast more powerful votes, but doing so will burn the tokens, and the amount of tokens burned per vote gained will increase exponentially--thus making Pazari economically impossible to take control of. 

The Pazari governance system and the uses for PGT are still in R&D and will take many months to develop, test, and implement, but we are looking at Pazari being run by a Merchants' DAO in the future rather than by a company.

All Pazari MVP Merchants who join the platform and help us make it usable for everyone prior to the deployment of the PGT tokens will be given an "airdrop" of PGT's initial supply as a reward for their contributions during the early phase of growth and development.

In conclusion, companies like Amazon and Shutterstock are run by CEOs and boards of directors who make decisions and expect their users to accept them even if it harms them, but Pazari will be run by a Merchants' DAO that will make the rules, set the fees, and even hire the upper management to make the fast decisions the DAO can't (or shouldn't need to).

### Gamified Success
The more revenue your Merchant's account generates for the platform the more levels the account will gain. Higher levels act as multipliers and modifiers in certain areas that will make your success on Pazari even more rewarding, and some levels will even unlock new tools and features. 

Merchant profiles will be able to earn achievements for completing challenges, and these achievements will also sometimes unlock new features and rewards. This gamified rewards system will provide incentives for Merchants to create and sell successful content, and will reward those who contribute the most toward the platform's continued survival and success in the future.

On top of that, your Merchant's account will be given a score based on many metrics such as the amount of revenue you have generated for Pazari, the amount of items you have sold, the amount 4-5 star reviews you have received, and the number customers who buy more than one item from you--among many other things.

However, selling junk content on Pazari will earn negative achievements, and will count against your Merchant account's overall score until the content has been removed from the marketplace. This will provide a community-based incentive structure that punishes Merchants who sell bad, low-quality, or overpriced content while rewarding those who provide great, high-quality, and reasonably priced content.


# Conclusion
We are excited to bring Pazari to the world, and we sincerely hope that you can change your life by selling through the Pazari marketplace. There are immediate benefits that are superior to Web2 just during Pazari's early days, and there will be many very powerful benefits and features that will be rolled out over time as Pazari grows from an idea and proof of concept into a Web3 leviathan of the Digital Age.
